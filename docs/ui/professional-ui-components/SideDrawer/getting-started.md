# RadSideDrawer Getting Started
This article will guide you through the process of adding a {% typedoc_link classes:RadSideDrawer %} instance to a page in your NativeScript application and initializing its content. 
> By design the `RadSideDrawer` is designed to be placed as a single child to your `Page`.

## Installation
Run the following command to add the plugin to your application:

```
tns plugin add nativescript-ui-sidedrawer
```

## Adding RadSideDrawer to your page
Then, in order to add a {% typedoc_link classes:RadSideDrawer %} instance in a page of your application, you need to define the following XML namespace:

- `xmlns:nsDrawer="nativescript-ui-sidedrawer"`.

The namespace here is called `nsDrawer`. Now you can access {% typedoc_link classes:RadSideDrawer %}'s APIs in your XML page. Adding an instance of {% typedoc_link classes:RadSideDrawer %} is done the following way:

<snippet id='sidedrawer-getting-started-xml'/>
<snippet id='sidedrawer-getting-started-binding-context'/>

As you can see, the {% typedoc_link classes:RadSideDrawer,member:mainContent %} and {% typedoc_link classes:RadSideDrawer,member:drawerContent %} properties have also been initialized with a set of UI elements to demonstrate how content is set to the {% typedoc_link classes:RadSideDrawer %}. The bindings and event handlers in the code snippets can be found in the next section.

## Binding properties on elements in the `drawerContent` and `mainContent`
Content defined in the drawer and main sections has access to the same `bindingContext` the drawer instance has. You can therefore bind properties on the `View` elements inside to properties exposed by the object behind the `bindingContext`. Considering the XML code above, here's a sample view-model code that is used as a binding context:

<snippet id='sidedrawer-getting-started-model'/>

The following screenshots demonstrate how the drawer looks like in that case:
